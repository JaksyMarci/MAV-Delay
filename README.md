//Under development//

TODO:

* A non-stupid way to store the daily statistics, e.g. a proper database. As of now, if the image gets cold booted, the data may be deleted.
* Some kind of frontend would be nice
* Additional statistics (train with most delay/day, largest collective delay within month, etc.)

Open to contributions, feel free to submit a pull request if you love MÁV as well.
